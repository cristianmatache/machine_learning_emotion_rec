# ML-EmotionRecognition

Implementation of decision tree and decision forest algorithms. Each of these algorithms will be used in order to identify six basic emotions from the human facial expressions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise) based on a labelled set of facial Action Units (AUs). AUs correspond to contractions of human facial muscles, which underlie each and every facial expression, including facial expressions of the six basic emotions.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
