# Machine Learning CBC 1 - Emotion Recognition

Implementation of decision tree and decision forest algorithms. Each of these algorithms will be used in order to identify six basic emotions from the human facial expressions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise) based on a labelled set of facial Action Units (AUs). AUs correspond to contractions of human facial muscles, which underlie each and every facial expression, including facial expressions of the six basic emotions.

## Getting Started

Install dependency libraries by running:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip
sudo pip install pipreqs
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

It will install pip3 alognside the following libraries: networkx, matplotlib, pandas, scipy, numpy.
